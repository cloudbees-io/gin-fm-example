= Gin application example

This example is for use with CloudBees platform, feature management.

Use this guide to connect the `gin-fm-example` Go application to your CloudBees platform feature management environment. Once connected, you can apply changes to feature flags, and observe the flag changes in your browser, http://localhost:8080/demo.

== Prerequisites

Be sure to have these requirements ready:

* A CloudBees SaaS platform account: https://cloudbees.io
* An existing or new Feature Management environment
* Go installed on your local machine
** Recommended: Go 1.20+ for macOS ARM64 (Apple M1/Pro)

== Clone the example repository

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cloudbees-io/gin-fm-example.git
cd gin-fm-example
----

== Open the app in your editor

Open the cloned repository in the `gin-fm-example` folder. If you're using VS Code and the `code` command is installed, use the following in the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
code .
----

Or open `main.go` in your preferred editor manually.

== Copy the SDK key

. In the CloudBees platform UI, navigate to *Feature management*.

. Retrieve the SDK key
.. Select *Installation instructions* in the upper right corner.
.. Follow the guided steps to:
*** Create or select an environment (for example, `goEnvTest`).
*** Create or select an application (for example, `goAppTest`).
*** Link the application to the environment.
.. Select *Go* as the SDK language. (This step generates a unique SDK key.)
.. In the code block, on the right side of the screen, copy the newly generated SDK key.

NOTE: You will come back to the Installation instructions page once the key is successfully saved and run in the `main.go` file in the Go app.

== Replace the SDK key in `main.go`

Back in your editor, open the `main.go` file.

. In the `main.go` file, find the `sdkKey := "<YOUR-SDK-KEY>"` line and paste in the newly generated SDK key, replacing the placeholder value:
+
[source,go]
----
sdkKey := "your-sdk-key-here"
----

. Check the `main.go` file to ensure the following lines are included:

.Ensure the fmt package is imported at the top of the file:
[source,go]
----
import "fmt"
----

.Also ensure the following lines inside the same initFlags() function to confirm successful flag registration:
[source,go]
----
fmt.Println("ROX SDK setup complete. Forcing flag registration:")
fmt.Println("showMessage:", flags.ShowMessage.IsEnabled(nil))
fmt.Println("message:", flags.Message.GetValue(nil))
fmt.Println("fontColor:", flags.FontColor.GetValue(nil))
fmt.Println("fontSize:", flags.FontSize.GetValue(nil))

----

== Install the Go SDK

In the terminal, inside the `gin-fm-example` folder run the following:

[source,bash]
----
go get -u github.com/rollout/rox-go/v5/...
----

==  Run the application

In the terminal, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
go run main.go
----

You should see:

[source,text]
----
Listening and serving HTTP on :8080
----

== Open the app in your browser

Copy the following and paste it into a browser window:

    http://localhost:8080/demo

Youâ€™ll see JSON output with flag-controlled values similar to:

[source,text]
----
{
    "fontColor": "Green",
    "fongSize": 12,
    "message": "Hello summer!"
}
----

== Confirm SDK connection in the UI

Back in the CloudBees platform:

. Return to the *Feature management > Installation instructions* page.
. Select *Test integration* at the bottom of the instructions page.
. You should see a success message indicating the SDK is connected.

== Modify and test flags

Next you will modify a flag configuration and observe the change in the browser.

. On the *Feature management > Flags* page.
. Choose your application (for example, goAppTest).
. Select the `ShowMessage` flag  and set it to *true*.
. Modify optional flags:
** `message` (custom string such as "Hello summer")
** `fontColor` (red, green, blue)
** `fontSize` (12, 16, 24)
. Select *Save configuration*.
. Set *Configuration status* to *On*.
. Refresh `http://localhost:8080/demo` to see your changes reflected.

== Troubleshooting

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Symptom | Fix

| No flags appear
| Ensure the correct SDK key is added and saved in `main.go`.

| "No SDK connection detected"
| Refresh `/demo` and re-test integration in the UI.

| Terminal shows `404` errors
| Ensure the SDK key is valid and internet connection is stable.

| Changes to a flag is not showing in the browser.
| Make sure the flag's configuration status is set to *On*.

| Cannot edit files in VS Code
| Confirm file permissions are not set to read-only.
