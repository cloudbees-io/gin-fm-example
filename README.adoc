= Example Gin application for CloudBees feature management

Use this example application to integrate with the CloudBees platform and test out feature management.
After integrating, watch the application display change in response to any updates you make to flag values in the platform.

In the example application, the ROX package is already set up, and feature flags are already coded in.

== Enter your SDK key

Your SDK key is a link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-platform/latest/feature-management/learn-about-feature-flags[unique environment identifier].

To generate the SDK key:

. Go to menu:Feature management[Installation].
. Select an environment (or create a new one).
. Select the appropriate SDK.
. The environment-specific SDK key is displayed within the `Rox.setup` call.
. Copy the SDK key, and then replace the example app placeholder with it.

== Run the application

After saving your SDK key in the example application, run the following command in the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
go run main.go
----

Then go to `http://localhost:8080/demo` to display the running application.

== Use the platform to update flag values

Now that your application is running, go to your environment in *Feature management* to display the flags available in the example application:

[cols="1a,1a,4a",options="header"]
.Feature flags in the example application.

. Select *Configure*.
. Select the *Environment* you used for copying the SDK key.
. Update a flag value and save your changes.
. Switch the *Configuration status* to *On*.

The updated flag value is soon reflected in the display of the application.
